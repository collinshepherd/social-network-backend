# Social Network Backend

I started this project to create a backend for a social media network. In creating this I was using MongoDB for the first time and was able to use Mongoose to create the database for the social network to use. You can see in the demo video how it works and all of the routes that were added for this application to use. I learned how to use MongoDB and I think I prefer it over MySQL.
